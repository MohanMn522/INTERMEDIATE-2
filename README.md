🚗 AI Self-Driving Cars
Revolutionizing autonomous vehicles with cutting-edge AI

📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates a basic AI-powered self-driving car simulation built using Python and Pygame. The goal is to showcase how autonomous vehicles can use sensor data and simple AI logic to navigate a road environment.

⚠️ Note: This is a simplified educational simulation and not intended for real-world autonomous vehicle deployment.

🧠 Features
Simple rule-based AI decision-making.

Simulated forward-facing sensors.

Basic road-following logic.

Visual rendering of car and environment in 2D.

Designed for learning and experimentation with AI in self-driving tech.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3

Pygame

(Optional extensions: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV for advanced AI)

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/self-driving-car-sim.git
cd self-driving-car-sim
2. Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pygame numpy
3. Run the simulation:
bash
Copy
Edit
python ai_self_driving_car.py
🧪 How It Works
The simulation uses basic AI rules to control the car:

It reads colors from two "sensors" on the left and right sides of the car.

If the left sensor sees the road and the right doesn't, it turns right.

If the right sensor sees the road and the left doesn't, it turns left.

Otherwise, it goes straight.

🧭 Future Improvements
Implement Deep Q-Learning for dynamic decision-making.

Add obstacles and collision detection.

Simulate traffic lights and intersections.

Integrate with simulators like CARLA or Unity ML-Agents.

Use real-world datasets for model training.
